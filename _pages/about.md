I am Huanzhuo Wu, a Ph.D. researcher at the Deutsche Telekom Chair of Communication Networks (ComNets) at TU Dresden, Germany. 
My work includes contributing to research projects, teaching, and supervising students of the faculty. 
My particular research interest is In-Network Computing, Software Defined Network, Algorithm Optimization, and Blind Source Separation.

From 2017 to 2020, I worked on a research project named 5Gang, together with Ericsson, Robert Bosch GmbH, RWTH Aachen, and other key partners.
Starting 2021, I am the lead of the research project with the name of Software Campus NetBliSS, in cooperation with Huawei Munich Research Center.
Both projects are funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research Germany (BMBF). 

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science at TU Dresden with honors. 
During my studies, I worked as a student assistant and completed internships at BMW AG in 2015 and Audi AG in 2016. 
I received my Bachelor degree in Engineering with honors in Computer Science in 2011 from Changâ€™an University, China.
